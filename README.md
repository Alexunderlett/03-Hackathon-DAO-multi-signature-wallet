## Short pitch



  - Solution: 


Our system belongs to the multi-signature management system of the DAO organization. Its function is an upgrade based on gnosis-safe, which allows the DAO organization to be more flexible in multi-signature management. At the same time, on the basis of multi-signature management, we have added the function of multi-signature DeFi controller, which can manage the funds in the multi-signature wallet. This system mainly includes the following functions:

1. Multi-signature wallet setup function: Anyone can establish a multi-signature wallet system between different wallet addresses, and approve the payment of funds in the form of multi-signature;


2. The multi-signature wallet agreement can be upgraded. Compared with gnosis-safe, the gnosis-safe multi-signature contract cannot change the information of the contract itself after deployment, but our contract can still change the multi-signature signer and multi-signature signing conditions through multi-signature approval, so that DAO's funds can be governed more flexible. 


3. We have added the function of the DeFi controller. First, the funds in the treasury can be used to increase liquidity for decentralized exchanges in the form of multi-signatures and obtain liquidity benefits; the other is that the funds in the treasury can be transferred to the treasury in the form of multi-signatures. The funds are deposited and withdrawn from the lending platform to obtain the proceeds of the lending.
Both of these functions use different forms to generate additional income from the funds in the multi-signature vault.




  - Pain: 



Our product mainly solves two pain points of the DAO organization:

1. Solve the flexible multi-signature management of the DAO organization treasury, establish different multi-signature management treasury, realize the multi-signature approval of the treasury, and at the same time change the multi-signature approver to realize the upgrade of the agreement;


2. Multi-sign DeFi controllers can realize the appreciation of funds in the treasury, allowing fixed funds to generate additional income.



  - Target audience: 

The target audience of our product is mainly various DAO organizations of various types. Meet their needs for financial management. Realize decentralized management of fund approval and fund appreciation through multi-signature wallets.

This product is suitable for all types of DAO organizations, whether it is a large DAO organization or a small DAO organization. Everyone can apply it to actual fund management. Its function is very practical for DAO organization.
